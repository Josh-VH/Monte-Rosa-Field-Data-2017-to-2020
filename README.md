# Monte-Rosa-Field-Data-2017-to-2020
Geological field work data within the Monte Rosa massife, obtained during research for a PhD at the University of Lausanne (maps, sample locations, structural measurements, and photographs)

In order to access data at each location point within separate layers on QGIS:

1) Change ‘Project Home’ directory to main file. For me: /Users/jvaughan/Documents/Monte-Rosa-Field-Data-2017-to-2020-main/

2) Enable ‘Show Map Tips’ in project toolbar (yellow speech bubble)

3) Right click layer click ‘Properties’

4) ‘Display’ (yellow speech bubble), html script should appear

5) ‘Apply’ —> ‘Ok’

Hovering over each point will enable a photograph / structural data / sample data to appear.

Repeat process for each layer when wanting to view data.

* Only one layer at a time can be viewed.

** All files must be kept in the same structure as was downloaded in order for pathnames to be accessed.
